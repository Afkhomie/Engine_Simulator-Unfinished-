## üéØ Overview

Version 1.3 is a **major physics upgrade** that transforms the Engine Simulator from a visual tachometer into a realistic physics simulation. Every aspect of the engine behavior now follows real-world physics principles.

## ‚ú® What's New

### **Stage 1: Core Engine Physics**

#### Gradual RPM Changes
- **Before**: RPM jumped instantly to target values
- **After**: Time-based acceleration with smooth rise/fall
- RPM acceleration rate affected by engine inertia, throttle, gear, and vehicle mass
- Different response in neutral (fast) vs in-gear (slower due to drivetrain load)

#### Idle RPM Stability
- Engine holds steady at 800 RPM (¬±50 RPM) when throttle < 5%
- Realistic idle fluctuation (¬±10 RPM random variation)
- No more erratic idle behavior

#### Real Power/Torque Math
- **Correct Formula**: Power(kW) = (Torque √ó RPM) / 9549, then converted to HP
- **Old Formula**: Approximation with incorrect constant
- Torque curve varies realistically with RPM and throttle
- Boost progressively affects torque (not instant multiplier)

#### Gear Ratio Speed Calculation
- Speed properly calculated from wheel RPM = engine RPM / (gear ratio √ó final drive)
- Each gear ratio accurately affects vehicle speed at given RPM

### **Stage 2: Physics Consistency**

#### Weight & Inertia Simulation
- Added vehicle mass property: 1400 kg (realistic for performance car)
- Mass affects how quickly engine can accelerate in-gear
- Heavier vehicles = slower RPM acceleration when in gear
- Engine inertia + vehicle mass = total inertia for calculations

#### Gradual Boost Spool
- **Turbocharger**: Gradual spool-up (realistic lag), faster spool-down
- **Supercharger**: Faster response but still not instant
- Boost increases with RPM and throttle (no instant max boost)
- Boost PSI limited to configured max (won't exceed safe limits)

#### Realistic Temperature Simulation
- **Oil Temperature**: Rises slowly with load, cools even slower (heat capacity)
- **Coolant Temperature**: Moderate heat/cool rates (active cooling system)
- **Intake Temperature**: Fast response, affected by boost compression (3.5√ó boost heating factor)
- All temperatures use realistic heat transfer coefficients
- Ambient temperature: 20¬∞C baseline

#### Temperature-Based Performance
- Coolant > 105¬∞C triggers overheating penalty
- Power/torque reduced by up to 30% when severely overheating
- Realistic simulation of heat-soaked engine performance loss

#### Real Fuel Consumption
- **Formula**: Base √ó RPM_factor √ó Throttle¬≤ √ó Boost_factor √ó Gear_load
- Throttle uses quadratic factor (wide-open throttle burns significantly more fuel)
- Boost increases consumption by up to 60% at max boost
- Lower gears use more fuel (higher load)
- Scales with engine displacement

### **Stage 3: User Interface Logic**

#### Gear Shift Logic
- **Shift Delay**: 200ms for sequential shifts, 250ms for manual gear selection
- RPM automatically adjusts based on gear ratio change:
  - **Upshift**: RPM drops (higher gear = lower RPM at same speed)
  - **Downshift**: RPM increases (lower gear = higher RPM at same speed)
- Over-rev protection on downshifts (limits to redline)
- Cannot shift while already shifting (prevents rapid-fire gear changes)

#### Proper Slider Integration
- **Volume Slider**: Directly controls audio engine volume (0-100%)
- **Boost Slider**: Sets max boost pressure (0-25 PSI)
- **Rev Limiter Slider**: Sets engine redline (3000-9000 RPM)
- All sliders update physics engine in real-time

---

### **Stage 4: Sound & Feedback**

#### Idle/Accel/Decel Sound Mapping
- **Idle Mode** (<1000 RPM, <10% throttle): Gentle, consistent rumble
- **Acceleration**: Intensity scales with throttle position
- **Deceleration**: Overrun crackle/pop effects at high RPM
- Distinct sound character for each engine state

#### Smooth Audio Transitions
- **Exponential Smoothing**: Frequency changes interpolate smoothly (smooth_factor = 0.3)
- **Fade In/Out**: Short envelopes at audio boundaries prevent clicks
- **Frequency Bounds**: Rumble 20-300 Hz, Exhaust 100-2000 Hz, Turbo 1500-5000 Hz
- Volume fades smoothly (no sudden volume jumps)

#### Advanced Sound Synthesis
- **Firing Order Variation**: 4-cylinder pattern simulation
- **Subharmonic Bass**: Deeper low-end at higher RPM (>2000 RPM)
- **Harmonic Layers**: Multiple exhaust harmonics (fundamental + 1st + 2nd)
- **Turbo Whistle**: Only audible under boost, intensity scales with PSI
- **Deceleration Crackle**: Random noise bursts with decay envelope

---

### **Stage 5: Dyno Mode & Fine Tuning**

#### Realistic Dyno Data
- Power/torque curves calculated with correct physics formula
- Shows both engine power and wheel power (corrected for drivetrain loss)
- Temperature warning: Performance affected above 105¬∞C

#### Drivetrain Loss
- 15% power loss between engine and wheels (realistic for RWD/AWD)
- Example: 250 HP engine = ~212 HP at wheels
- Simulates transmission, differential, and driveshaft losses

#### Vehicle Information
- Displays vehicle mass (1400 kg)
- Shows drivetrain loss percentage
- Temperature performance warning

   # Using MinGW
   g++ -shared -fPIC -O3 engine_physics.cpp engine_physics_wrapper.cpp -o engine_physics.dll
   ```

## üéÆ What You'll Notice

### Immediate Differences
- RPM rises/falls smoothly instead of jumping

- Temperatures rise/fall gradually
- Audio sounds smoother, no popping

### Gameplay Changes

- Overheating actually hurts performance
- Fuel consumption is more realistic (boost = thirsty)
- Engine feels more connected to vehicle mass

### Visual Changes
- Dyno page shows more information
- Info page lists v1.3 improvements
- Window title shows "v1.3"

## üí° Tips for Best Experience

1. **Feel the difference**: Try accelerating in neutral vs in gear
2. **Shift smoothly**: You'll hear/feel RPM adjustments during shifts
3. **Manage boost**: Watch boost gauge spool up gradually
4. **Monitor temps**: Keep coolant below 105¬∞C for best performance
5. **Listen to audio**: Idle, accel, and decel all sound different now
6. **Use rev limiter**: Set it appropriately for your engine
7. **Watch fuel**: High RPM + high throttle + boost = fuel consumption
