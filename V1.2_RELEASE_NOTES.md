# Engine Simulator v1.2 - Release Notes

## Overview

Engine Simulator v1.2 is a maintenance and bug-fix release that improves stability, error handling, and audio system reliability. The application continues to provide a professional-grade engine simulation experience with real-time physics and audio synthesis.

## What's Fixed in v1.2

### Critical Fixes
‚úÖ **Audio Callback Logic** - Fixed improper condition check that could cause audio processing errors
‚úÖ **Frequency Bounds** - Prevented invalid audio frequencies that could cause audio distortion
‚úÖ **Error Handling** - Added comprehensive try-catch blocks to prevent crashes
‚úÖ **Parameter Validation** - Improved volume and frequency parameter clamping

### Improvements
‚úÖ Better error messages for debugging
‚úÖ Improved fallback behavior when C++ DLL isn't available
‚úÖ Enhanced documentation
‚úÖ Optimized performance

## System Requirements

- **Windows 10/11** (64-bit)
- **Python 3.8+**
- **RAM**: 2GB minimum
- **Disk Space**: 500MB

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Python Dependencies
```powershell
pip install numpy
pip install pyaudio  # Optional for audio (recommended)
```

### 2. Run the Application
```powershell
python main_app.py
```

The app will automatically use pure Python physics if the C++ DLL isn't available. Audio will fall back to a simple generator if PyAudio isn't installed.

## Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **E** | Start/Stop Engine |
| **SPACE** | Throttle (hold) |
| **B** | Brake (hold) |
| **SHIFT** | Gear Up |
| **CTRL** | Gear Down |
| **BACKSPACE** | Clutch Toggle |
| **D** | Dyno View |
| **G** | Builder View |
| **I** | Info View |

## Features

### Core Simulation
- Real-time physics engine (pure Python with optional C++ acceleration)
- 4 engine presets + custom builder
- 6-speed manual transmission + reverse
- Turbocharger/Supercharger simulation
- Complete fuel system with consumption tracking
- Temperature monitoring (Oil, Coolant, Intake Air)

### Audio
- Real-time engine sound synthesis
- Engine rumble, exhaust notes, turbo whistle
- Dynamic audio based on RPM and boost
- Volume control (0-100%)
- Graceful fallback if PyAudio unavailable

### Performance Metrics
- RPM tracking with gauge
- Speed in km/h
- Power in HP
- Torque display (Nm)
- Fuel level and consumption
- 0-100 km/h timing
- Distance and runtime tracking

### User Interface
- Professional dark-mode design
- 4-page navigation (Simulator, Builder, Dyno, Info)
- Real-time digital gauges
- Responsive controls
- Keyboard shortcut hints

## Known Limitations

1. **C++ DLL**: The optional C++ physics engine requires manual compilation
2. **Audio**: PyAudio is optional but recommended for audio features
3. **Graphs**: Advanced dyno graphs require matplotlib (placeholder in current version)

## Troubleshooting

### Application won't start
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Check that NumPy is installed: `pip install numpy`

### No audio output
- Install PyAudio: `pip install pyaudio`
- The app will continue to work with visual-only mode

### Low FPS/Performance Issues
- Close other applications
- Update graphics drivers
- Consider compiling the C++ physics engine for better performance

### "Could not load engine_physics.dll"
This is a warning, not an error. The app automatically uses pure Python physics instead.

## Compilation (Optional)

To compile the C++ physics engine for better performance:

### Using Microsoft Visual C++
```bash
cl.exe /LD engine_physics.cpp engine_physics_wrapper.cpp /Fe:engine_physics.dll
```

### Using MinGW
```bash
g++ -shared -fPIC -O3 engine_physics.cpp engine_physics_wrapper.cpp -o engine_physics.dll
```

### Using Clang
```bash
clang++ -shared -O3 engine_physics.cpp engine_physics_wrapper.cpp -o engine_physics.dll
```
